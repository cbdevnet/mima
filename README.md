# MIMA Toolchain
A set of tools for developing/testing MIMA assembler code, written in plain C.  

## mimasm
mimasm transforms [assembly instructions](mimasm/MIMA-ASSEMBLER.txt) into an intermediate representation (memory map). This memory map can then be viewed and experimented with, or it can be fed to mimasim for execution.

### Features
*   Cross-platform, builds on Windows, Linux and BSD
*   Supports complete instruction set
*   Keeps labels in memory map for runtime resolving
*   Outputs intermediate format accepted by multiple interpreters

### Download & Resources
*   [github.com/cbdevnet/mima](https://github.com/cbdevnet/mima/) - mimasm and mimasim on github
*   [mimasm/](mimasm/) - The mimasm project
*   [mimasm/mimasm.c](mimasm/mimasm.c) - main source
*   [mimasm/MIMA-ASSEMBLER.txt](mimasm/MIMA-ASSEMBLER.txt) - Assembly language documentation
*   [mimasm/demo-sort.txt](mimasm/demo-sort.txt) - Demonstration source sorting an array

**CAVEAT:** Labels in assembly code must be followed by a colon (**:**), which is frequently omitted from worksheets but mentioned and used in [advanced material](http://ti.ira.uka.de/Visualisierungen/Mima/mima-aufgaben.pdf) as well as the non-authoritative MIMA-ASSEMBLER.txt supplied with mimasim.

## mimasim
mimasim allows you to execute a memory map generated by mimasm (or written by yourself), either in a single run or interactively. It supports the full MIMA instruction set, as well as adding support for breakpoints, runtime label resolution and interactive memory inspection.

### Features
*   Cross-platform, builds on Windows, Linux and BSD
*   Supports complete instruction set
*   Easy-to-understand and useful [input file format (memory map)](mimasim/demo-sort.mima)
*   Useful (optional) [output file format](mimasim/SAMPLE-OUTPUT.txt)
*   Interactive execution, including memory inspection
*   Breakpoint functionality for debugging complex programs
*   Run-time label resolution
*   Arbitrary program entry point
*   Arbitrary run-time step limit

## Building
The toolchain was successfully compiled on the following systems

*   Linux (Debian, Arch Linux, Ubuntu)
*   BSD (FreeBSD, OpenBSD)
*   Windows (XP, 7)

using the following compilers

*   tcc (Linux, Windows)
*   gcc (Linux, BSD)
*   clang (BSD)
*   dmc (Windows)

Running `make` in the respective subfolders on a system with at least one of these compilers (and some form of `make`) installed should result in a successful build.

## About the MIMA
The MIMA is a greatly simplified example of a microcomputer (hence the name, MInimal MAchine), used for demonstration and educational purposes in lectures at the [KIT](http://kit.edu/). The original work in developing the MIMA and its instruction set has been done by Prof. T. Asfour ([http://ti.ira.uka.de/](http://ti.ira.uka.de/)).

## Bug Bounty
The first 10 people to report a critical (as in, crashes on execution or missing/erroneous/broken functionality), not yet submitted/known bug or fix a listed known bug in the latest releases of either mimasim or mimasm are eligible, upon disclosure of said bug/fix to cb@cbcdn.com, to receive one Club Mate each (in Person, in Karlsruhe, at the KIT, in the FSMI) from me ;)
