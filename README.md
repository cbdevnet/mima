MIMATools
=========

A set of tools to make testing/running/debugging/verifying code for the MIMA Architecture that is used in teaching at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology easier.

mimasm will take your code as input and output an ASCII representation of the resulting memory map (really useful for some assignments). The feature set is believed to be complete.

A documentation of MIMA assembler can be found in mimasm/MIMA-ASSEMBLER.txt


mimasim will take such a memory map and execute it, allowing you to specify entry point, label resolving, output verbosity and such. 

A detailed workflow example can be found in mimasim/WORKFLOW.txt

This repository only contains the latest "release" tags. The latest "development" version is at http://dev.cbcdn.com/kit/
