MIMA Assembler workflow

1. Write your code (See mima-assembler.txt and the example files)
using notepad or some other plain-text editor

2. Assemble using
	mimasm file.txt			will produce out.mima
or	mimasm file.txt file.mima	will produce file.mima

3. If you're feeling adventurous, open the output file with a text
editor and have a look at the memory layout

4. Run the simulator in any of the following ways (or just run mimasim without any arguments to see whats possible)
	mimasim in.mima			will simulate the execution and show you the memory contents on exit
	mimasim in.mima out.txt		will create a listing of all execution steps and states in out.txt
	mimasim in.mima out.txt -v	will do the same, but will also display the corresponding labels (if present)
	mimasim in.mima -i		will allow you to step through the execution of your program interactively
	mimasim in.mima -i -v		will do the same and display labels (if present)

5. The previous step will show you if your program has the desired output
or runs into any infinite loops, making it easier to debug.
